# Machine-learning-diamonds
Creation of a ML model with a diamonds dataset
This repository have two files. I recommend you explore 'Regression with Diamonds' first and then move onto 'Diamonds & Shap'. This is because the first Jupyter notebook 
has the dataset feature description and the exploratory analysis.
